# 1. Create a Fractal-Compressed QR Code
def create_fractal_qr(data, size=500, compression_factor=0.5):
    """
    Generate a QR code from data and apply a simple fractal compression simulation.
    
    Theoretical Function:
    - Creates a scannable QR code containing the input data.
    - Simulates fractal compression by resizing the image (reducing resolution) and then upscaling it,
      mimicking self-similar pattern reuse typical in fractal compression.
    
    Conceptual Strategy:
    - QR codes are typically binary images; fractal compression leverages self-similarity to reduce data size.
    - Here, we simulate compression for simplicity, but a real implementation might use Iterated Function Systems (IFS).
    - The QR code could encode metadata about the 3D object or reconstruction parameters.

def capture_3d_from_2d(angles, image_dir="images"):
    """
    Load 2D images from files taken at specified angles to prepare for 3D reconstruction.
    
    Theoretical Function:
    - Collects images representing an object from multiple viewpoints.
    - In a real system, this would involve camera captures; here, we load pre-existing files.
    
    Conceptual Strategy:
    - Multiple angles provide depth information via parallax.
    - Systematic angle selection (e.g., 0°, 45°, 90°) ensures comprehensive coverage of the object.
    - Assumes images are pre-captured and named by angle for simplicity.

    - Placeholder for Structure from Motion (SfM) or Multi-View Stereo (MVS).
    
    Conceptual Strategy:
    - Real 3D reconstruction uses feature matching and triangulation; here, we simulate with a voxel grid.
    - Each image contributes intensity data to a 3D space, averaged for simplicity.
    - Output is a 3D numpy array representing occupancy or intensity.

    Theoretical Function:
    - Flattens 3D data into a 2D image while embedding fractal-like properties.
    - Uses a simple projection with color encoding based on 3D coordinates.
    
    Conceptual Strategy:
    - Fractal properties could involve self-similar patterns; here, we use coordinate-based coloring.
    - Projects 3D points to 2D, scaling coordinates to fit the mosaic size.
    - Could be enhanced with fractal algorithms like L-systems or IFS for true self-similarity.

    Theoretical Function:

    - Simulates motion to reveal 3D or fractal aspects over time.
    
    Conceptual Strategy:
    - Simple row shifting mimics a conveyor effect; here, we use rotation for a more 3D-like feel.
    - Each frame slightly alters the mosaic, enhancing visual engagement.
    - Could integrate fractal transformations for more complexity.
